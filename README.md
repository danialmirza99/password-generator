## Description

In this assignment, I worked with Javascript. I was tasked with generating a random password. The program asks the user for their preferred password length, then proceeds to ask which type of characters they want in their password. The options are lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If the user chooses to omit all of the four options or selects a password length that is out of scope, then no password is generated. This program uses for loops, functions, alerts, and prompts.
